    "The Excel STDEV.S Function is used to calculate the standard deviation in the sample data set. The S in STDEV.S stands for Sample.  It means there is more data out there than we currently have. So the real standard deviation of the data is not known. We have a piece of it so will try and calculate it from the piece we do have. [3.3]  A sample may be used as it is easier and cheaper than having to to look at all of the population but does not take into account the possible bias if the sample set is taken which doesnt adequately represent the full population so accuracy is lost. And maybe there is no access to the entire population.\n",

    "If the same values were given for both formulas the sample standard deviation will result in a higher value for the standard deviation as the sample size minus one is the denominator.  A standard deviation of a sample can underestimate the true population standard deviation so when the formula is used, estimating the population standard deviation using a sample, the standard deviation for the sample itself is still the population standard deviation.  The true standard deviation for the results would use the STDEV.P formula.  The STDEV.S would be used when you want to estimate what the true population standard deviation is based on a sample.\n",
