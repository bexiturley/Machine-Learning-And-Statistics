Contained within Tasks.ipynd file is my submission through Jupyter notebook.  <br>

Task 1 - Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library  or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

Task 2 - Use scipy.stats to verify the Chi-squared value on a Wikipedia article is approximately 24.6. value and calculate the associated p value.

Task 3 - Research Excel functions STDEV.P and STDEV.S. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. 

Task 4 - Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set.  Explain how the code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.



Accessing the project
***
The best way to access the code for this project is to clone the repository from Github:
https://github.com/bexiturley/Machine-Learning-And-Statistics.git or Jupyter Notebooks viewer, https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.  Where indicated, paste the link to the notebook to be viewed.


Getting started with JupyterLab
***

Install with conda
If you use conda, you can install it with:
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

Install with pip
If you use pip, you can install it with:
pip install jupyterlab

Detailed instructions are available from https://jupyter.org/install

Running Jupyter
On Windows, you can run Jupyter via Anaconda or cmder.  Navigate to the folder in which the desired file is contained and type jupyter notebook, which will open a new tab in your default web browser and have an address similar http://localhost:8888/tree, indicating the content is being served from your own computer.  The Jupyter server is now running and can be worked upon.
