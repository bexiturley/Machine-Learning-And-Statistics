    "November 2nd, 2020 : The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.\n",

An alpha level of 1% would be tiny and increase the chance of **NOT**  rejecting the null.  So it is a balancing act to avoid blindly rejecting or accepting the null and possibly incorrectly influencing the result. Therefore a 5% level is widely accepted as a good compromise.  I also look at it as an in inbuilt margin of error, if you are collecting data there may be inconsistencies due to various factors e.g. mishearing a reply or incorrectly recording the response.

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate both the Chi-squared and its associated p value can be easily arrived at by using cipy.stats.chi2_contingency.  I went a bit further and looked at how to manually calculate it so as to acquaint myself with the theory behind it and how it works, both to get a better understanding about it and to verify the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My results are that the Chi-squared value is approximately 24.6 and its associated P value is 0.00040987793499891456.  If the chi-squared value was 0 then that would indicate that the actual data and expected data were identical with no difference.  This is not the case here as the value is 24.6.  The lower the number the greater chance of both actual and expected data being similar.  24.6 is not very high so would indicate that both actual and expected values were broadly similar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The P value is far less than alpha 0.00040987793499891456 vs 0.05 and is statistically significant.   It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.  Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, the alternative hypothesis is accepted and conclude that location and collar status are not independent of each other and there is a relationship between them.  What it doesn’t do is provide insights on how the variables are dependent or what kind of relationship exists, just there is a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <br>From taking a quick look at the actual vs expected values, it appears that there is a big difference in white collar in area B.  It is significantly lower than expected.  This trend is continued through to the blue collar in the same area but to the opposite effect.  There are a greater number of actual values as opposed to the expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The no collar category also has the biggest difference in area B where actual is greater than expected.  Area C seems broadly in line where expected meets actual values.  It could be interesting that Area B with the biggest differences between expected and actual is beside area C with the nearest matching values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a noticeable difference in area D for blue collar with the actual value a lot smaller than the expected.  Conversely the opposite again appears for white collar in D where there the actual values are a lot higher than expected.  There seems to be an opposite effect on the values between blue collar and white collar.  Where there is a higher than expected value for one, it has the effect of negatively influencing the other resulting in lower than expected values.  Without further information it would be hard to identify a reason for this but it may be that area D is more expensive hence the greater white collar values.  If that was the case then the opposite could be said for area B with a lot less than expected white collar but higher than expected blue collar.  \n",
